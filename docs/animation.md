# Animation, asset banks and zones: what the title's code does

What was worked out of the title while finding the bind pose after a
restart (the memset, see [native_crt.cpp](../CoD3Host/native_crt.cpp)),
written down so the next fault in this part of the game starts from here.
Addresses are the executable's; each level DLL has its own copy of the C
runtime but not of these systems. `COD3_TRACEANIMHEAP=1` turns on the
traces in [anim_heap_trace.cpp](../CoD3Host/anim_heap_trace.cpp) that
look at everything below while the game runs.

## Asset banks

A level's assets arrive in place: each `.cod` archive holds a bank that is
used where it is loaded, not copied into other structures.

- **Bank header**: `"IIBS"` (0x49494253), a version (0x4000A3D7), the
  number of types (13), a pointer to the type records, a pointer to the
  bank's end. Each type record is 32 bytes: +0 type id, +4 the type's name
  (twelve characters), +16 a hash mask, +20 the hash table, +24 the number
  of entries, +28 the entries (8 bytes each; the resource pointer at +4).
  Names are looked up as hashes (sub_820CEBB8 hashes a string) in
  sub_820C0168(bank, type, 0, name).
- **The thirteen types**, the same in every bank:

  | id | type | id | type |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 0 | TEXTURE | 7 | ANIMOFFSET |
  | 1 | FONT | 8 | SKELETON |
  | 2 | MESHFILE | 9 | EFFECT |
  | 3 | MESH | 10 | FX |
  | 4 | ANIMFILE | 11 | DISCTEX |
  | 5 | ANIM (a nalAnimClass) | 12 | DISCTEXSIZE |
  | 6 | SCNANIM | | |

- **The resource manager** at `*(0x82A2AB68)` keeps a bank per id at
  +(13 + id) * 4. sub_8245A0F8(manager, type, zone, name) and
  sub_8245A1D8 gather the banks to search (for ANIM and SKELETON every
  loaded bank, sub_82455248; otherwise one zone's, sub_82459E80, or every
  loaded one, sub_824598F0) and return the first match.
- **The bank set** at `*(0x82A2AB6C)` (an `InplaceAssetBankSet<ZoneBoundaryBank>`)
  keeps a zone object per id at +(11 + id) * 4 and three ids at +28, +32
  and +40: the anim bank, the global bank and the level's own bank.
  sub_82458668(set, id) finds a zone, with a cache at +(110 + id) * 4.
- **Zone objects** are 208 bytes and lie one after another: +0 / +4 next
  and previous, +12 the archive's path, +76 a number that differs by zone
  (0 global, 2 anim, 3 the level, 4 the zn zones, 6 veh and defense2,
  7 char, 8 weapons, 9 fx) and at 10 makes the zone unusable, its meaning
  not settled, +136 the zone's id, +140 its bank once resolved
  (sub_82456198), +200 its state (3 loaded; unloading goes 4, 5, 7 in
  sub_82462648 and ends with the script notify `"unloaded_<zone>"`).
- **Chambois' ids**: 0 global.cod, 1 anim.cod, 3 weapons, 4 char.cod,
  5 veh.cod, 6 fx.cod, 7 Chambois.cod, 8 zn01, 9 defense2, 10 zn02,
  11 zn03, 12 zn05. The zones are read once at the level's load; a restart
  after a death reads none of them again.
- **The stream zone manager** at 0x826E4C00 (its address in
  `*(0x82A2AB74)`; made once, sub_82457FE0 from sub_825372E8) handles only the zones streamed in during play: a
  slot per zone id from +4, two lists whose heads are at +436 and +444,
  linked through the zone's +68.

The animations of every level sit in anim.cod's bank; the loader for
loose animation files (sub_82173808, "Attempt to load already loaded
AnimFile %s") and its release (sub_82173AD8) never run in a level.

## Animation trees

The IW engine's XAnim, next to Treyarch's nal library.

- **Anim lists** (what a script's `#animtree` names): 12 bytes, name,
  count, entries. Chambois has 34, in a table at `*(0x82A2A204)`:
  generic_human (1216 animations), mg42 (13), opel_blitz (2), panzerIV (4),
  tankdeadguys (7), each weapon and its `_arms` (25 each), and
  drone_animtree (42).
- **An entry** is 28 bytes: +0 the name's hash, +4 the number of children
  (0 for an animation), +6 the parent's index, +8 the nal animation class
  once resolved, +12 the notetrack once built, +16 the generation of the
  last attempt to resolve it, +24 flags, +26 the first child's index.
- **A tree** (entity +552) is (count + 12) * 2 bytes: +0 / +4 next and
  previous in the list of live trees at 0x825F5190 (count, then the
  first), +8 its anim list, +12 the entity's +500 (the low half is the
  model), +16 the bank its entity's assets come from (entity +496, or the
  level's bank from the set's +40), +20 the number of info records it
  holds, then from +24 a 16-bit slot per animation: 0 when the animation
  is idle, otherwise the info record that plays it. A tree whose every
  slot is 0 leaves its model in the bind pose.
- **The info pool**: 4096 records of 52 bytes at 0x82A59DB0; record 0 is
  the sentinel, whose +12 heads the free list (+12 next, +10 previous).
  A record's +16 and +36 are the floats the script's getters read
  (sub_82538A28, sub_825389E8), +32 the goal weight "set anim" tests for
  zero, +44 a nal instance released when the record goes; the rest is not
  worked out. The pool is made once
  at start (sub_824F9498) and has no lock; one thread uses it.

The functions, by what they do:

| function | does |
|---|---|
| sub_824FD368 | makes a tree for an entity and list, puts it on the live list |
| sub_824F2238 | frees a tree (off the live list, back to its heap) |
| sub_824F3F50 | clears a tree, giving back every record |
| sub_824FCF68 | takes a record for a slot |
| sub_824F2348 | gives a record back (copies of it inline in sub_824F7D90 and sub_824F7F90) |
| sub_824FE120 | sets an animation's goal weight, the core of the rest |
| sub_82500A40 | "set anim": the weight, and every parent at 0 raised to 1 |
| sub_82500B80 | sets the weight and leaves the parents' weights alone |
| sub_824FE410 | "knob all": the weight, the siblings let go (sub_824F73D8), the parents up to a given one set to 1 |
| sub_824F0E38 | makes the missing parents of a node, at weight 0 |
| sub_824F0FC0 | the leaf that carries most weight under a node |
| sub_824F7D90 | the per-frame update's giving back of what has finished |
| sub_824FAF40 | resolves an entry's name to its animation class (type 5, all banks), once per generation at 0x825D19E8 |
| sub_824F9148 | builds an entry's notetrack from the class's `COD_Note` component on `fakeroot` or `tag_origin`: script string, hash, time as a fraction, then `end` |
| sub_824F7F90 | at a restart (`map_restart`, sub_824EB848; the death restart, sub_824EC048): every record every live tree holds given back, every entry unresolved |

The script methods that reach them are in a table of (id, function) pairs
at about 0x825F6300: 0x674 (sub_824AD578) and 0x694 (sub_824AD3C8) set a
knob; 0x6A0 (sub_824B29E8) and 0x6A4 (sub_824B28E8) set and clear an
entity's tree ("cannot change the animtree of classname '%s'"). The ids'
names are nowhere in the executable or in a loaded level: the compiled
scripts name built-ins by number. They can be named only by what they do.

Entity types seen with trees: 7 the drones (drone_animtree), 11 and 13
the actors and the player's (generic_human, weapons).

## The nal library's memory

- **AnimHeap**, four megabytes made once at start (sub_82400098,
  `*(0x82A2A144)`): allocate sub_82522CB8 refuses past four megabytes,
  free sub_82522CB0.
- Its one user is the **decoded animation cache** at 0x82914EE0 (the heap,
  then the least and the most recently used entry). An entry is the
  owner's slot that points back at it, next, previous, size, and its
  chunks. When the heap refuses, the cache drops its least recently used
  entry (sub_82174388) and tries again, so a full heap, which Chambois
  reaches in about a hundred seconds, is its normal state.
- The nal library's complaints go through sub_82144CA8, which the release
  build left empty; `COD3_TRACETITLE=1` prints them.

## The destructor that runs twice

Checked again with the host's memset: with its fix turned off
(`COD3_NODTORFIX=1`), a `spmap` from inside a level still destroys every
object of the teardown list twice (sub_823F0828 and the deleting
destructor sub_820C8478 both call sub_823F04B0), frees their blocks a
second time, and a malloc bin closes into a loop: the game stops. The fix
in title_fixes.cpp stays. A restart after a death does not tear the level
down this way at all.

## Tools

- `COD3_MEMDUMP=hexaddress,hexsize,seconds,path[;...]` writes guest memory
  to files while the game runs (the physical heap is 0xA0000000, 0x20000000
  bytes; the running image 0x82000000, 0x1000000).
- `COD3_IMAGEDUMP=path` writes the image before the title starts.
- `scripts/xref.py`, `scripts/rtti.py`, `scripts/cut_tails.py`.
