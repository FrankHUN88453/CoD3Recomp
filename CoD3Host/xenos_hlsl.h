// The console's shader microcode as HLSL, for the D3D11 backend.
//
// A program is a control flow block of exec instructions, each running a
// run of ALU and fetch instructions from the same words. The translation
// is straightforward and literal: every register is a float4, every ALU
// instruction becomes the vector operation on its three operands and the
// scalar operation on the third, written through their masks, exports go
// to the outputs, fetches become loads from the vertex buffers or samples
// from the textures. What the hardware did implicitly - the viewport, the
// interpolator handover - is done by the epilogue and the backend.
