// The pipeline state objects, cached: blend, depth stencil, rasteriser and
// sampler states made once for each distinct combination the title asks
// for, and found again by an integer handle.
//
// A state is looked up by the register words that define it. The words
// are hashed into a small open addressing table; a hit is a compare of the
// words and an index, a miss creates the object. A frame asks for a few
// thousand states and gets the same twenty or so, so the table is never
// large and the lookup is a handful of loads with no allocation.
