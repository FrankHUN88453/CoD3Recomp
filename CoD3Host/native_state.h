// the draw call was made, not as the register file has it when the command
// processor gets there.
//
// The device keeps a copy of every register it writes (the shadows the
// dirty masks send out before each draw); what else its stream sets (the
// title's own material blocks, constants from memory, the Z pass's own
// state) is read from the stream as it is written (native_state.cpp).
// Recorded keeps a draw's state by its packet's last word, and Check holds
// it against the register file when the command processor reaches the
// packet: the parity that has to hold before the draws can be made from
// these records alone.
