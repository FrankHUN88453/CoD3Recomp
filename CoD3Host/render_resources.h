// The GPU resources behind the title's memory: its textures and vertex
// buffers uploaded once and kept, its render targets as textures, the
// surfaces its resolves make, and the rings its indices and constants
// stream through.
//
// Everything is found by an integer handle from a small table keyed by
// what the title names it by: a texture by its address, format and size,
// a vertex buffer by its address, a render target by its surface words
// and the scale. What the title changes under a resource (its dynamic
// vertex buffers, the HUD's textures) is caught by a fingerprint taken
// once a frame, not once a draw.
