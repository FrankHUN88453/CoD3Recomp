// Completion routines.
//
// An asynchronous read on this console does not call back from inside the read.
// The kernel queues the routine against the thread that asked, returns
// STATUS_PENDING, and runs it later, when that thread next waits. A title that
// streams a file relies on the whole shape of that: it issues a read, goes back
// to its loop, and only when the routine runs does it ask for the next block.
//
// This runtime used to ignore the routine entirely, and the title read the
// first four hundred kilobyte block of its eight megabyte archive and then
// waited for a completion that was never going to come.
//
// A routine runs when the thread waits and says it may be interrupted, which is
// what the console does. One that has waited longer than a frame runs anyway: a
// routine that is queued and never delivered is the failure this exists to
// prevent.
