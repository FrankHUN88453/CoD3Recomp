// The renderer: the title's frames drawn on the host GPU through Direct3D 11.
//
// The title's own graphics driver writes a Xenos command stream, and the
// command processor in gpu.cpp decodes that into register writes and the
// calls below. Nothing past this point is a model of the console's GPU:
// the registers of a draw are read once into a plain render state
// (render_state.h), the state is mapped to cached Direct3D objects
// (render_pipeline.h), the title's programs are translated to HLSL once
// and kept (render_shaders.h), its vertex buffers and textures are uploaded
// once and kept (render_resources.h), and the draw is one Direct3D call.
// The layers, from the title down:
//
//   game logic (recompiled)  ->  PM4 packets  ->  register file (gpu.cpp)
//     -> Render::Draw / Resolve / Swap             (this interface)
//     -> DrawState, the registers read once         (render_state.h)
//     -> DrawCommand: handles, not descriptions     (render_state.h)
//     -> caches: pipeline, shaders, resources       (render_*.h)
//     -> Direct3D 11, one context, one thread       (render_d3d11.cpp)
//
// The command thread draws; the window thread only pumps messages. The
// swap packet ends the title's frame, and that is where the frame is put on
// the window, with or without vertical sync as the settings say.
