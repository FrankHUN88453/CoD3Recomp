// Six hardware threads, the way the console has them.
//
// The console runs six hardware threads and every guest thread sits on one of
// them. Two threads on the same one cannot run at the same instant: the
// hardware alternates between them. A title can rely on that, and this one
// looks as though it does. It hands memory out of a frame arena with a single
// unlocked cursor from more than one thread, which is safe if those threads
// never overlap and corrupts itself if they do.
//
// This runtime ran every guest thread on its own host core, so they did
// overlap. Here each hardware thread is a lock, and a guest thread holds its
// own while it runs guest code.
//
// Two things keep that from turning into a hang. Every kernel call that can
// block releases the lock first and takes it again afterwards, so a thread
// waiting for another never holds the slot they share. And the lock is only
// ever waited for with a timeout: if something is held longer than it should
// be, the thread runs anyway and the serialisation is merely imperfect, rather
// than the title stopping dead.
