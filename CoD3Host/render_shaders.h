// The title's programs, as Direct3D shaders: translated from the microcode
// once, compiled once, kept for the run and on disk for the next.
//
// A program is known by the hash of its microcode. The stream's upload of
// a program (IM_LOAD) hashes the words where they lie and looks the hash
// up; a draw then only reads the stage's current entry. A new program is
// translated to HLSL and compiled on a worker thread while the frames go
// on without the draws that need it, unless the compiled bytecode is in
// the disk cache, in which case neither happens: the cache file carries
// the translation's metadata beside the bytecode, keyed by the microcode
// hash and the translator's version.
//
// The microcode of every program seen is also written out once, under
// the working directory's shaders folder, so the next run can compile
// what is not cached before the level needs it (Precompile).
