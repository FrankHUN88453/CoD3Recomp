//
// On this console r13 points at a per thread block, and guest code reads its
// own thread state straight out of it rather than asking the kernel. Two
// idioms in the title's own code name the layout beyond any doubt: reading
// r13+0x100 then +0x14C is how it gets its thread id, and writing r13+0x100
// then +0x160 is how it records its last error.
//
// This runtime left r13 as zero, so every one of those reads went to guest
// address zero and came back as zero. Every thread believed it was thread
// zero, and every timestamp read this way was the same instant forever. That
// last part is what mattered: the title's loading watchdog waits until either
// the thing it is watching changes or five seconds pass, and with a clock that
// never advances, five seconds never pass.
