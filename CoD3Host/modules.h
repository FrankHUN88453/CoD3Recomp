// The levels' own code.
//
// Every single player level of this title ships its script code compiled to
// PowerPC in a XEX DLL of its own (sp\<level>\<level>.dll), which the title
// loads with XexLoadImage when the level starts and asks for one export from.
// Each DLL is recompiled like the title itself, into a library named for the
// level, and this loads the DLL's image into guest memory when the title asks
// and switches the indirect call table to that level's functions.
//
// All the DLLs share one image base, so at most one is loaded at a time,
// which is also how the title uses them.
