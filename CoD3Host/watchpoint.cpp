// Catching whoever writes a particular word of guest memory.
//
// When a value that was right becomes wrong, the useful question is not what it
// is now but who changed it, and no amount of polling answers that: by the time
// a poll notices, the writer is long gone.
//
// The processor can answer it directly. A debug register holds an address and a
// length, and the processor raises a single step exception on the instruction
// that writes there. The vectored handler this runtime already has for guest
// memory then names the guest function, exactly as it does for a fault.
//
// Debug registers are per thread, so the watch has to be armed on every thread
// that could do the writing, including ones that start later.
