// The title's script threads, as host fibers.
//
// A level's script threads are coroutines. The engine gives each one a
// stack region below its own frame; to run one it copies the thread's saved
// stack back into that region, loads the thread's registers from the frame
// at the top of it and branches to where the thread left off. The thread
// yields by saving its registers to that frame, copying its stack out to a
// chain of chunks and longjmp'ing to the engine's setjmp. The engine's
// half of this is fine on the host: setjmp and longjmp are the host's own.
// The other half is not: "branch to where the thread left off" is a jump
// into the middle of a function, which the recompiled code cannot do.
//
// So each script thread gets a host fiber. The engine's resume point hands
// the fiber the registers the engine loaded and switches to it; a fresh
// thread's fiber calls the thread's entry function, a suspended one is
// already inside its yield and simply continues. The thread's yield, seen
// at the longjmp, switches back to the engine's fiber instead, which then
// performs the longjmp the thread asked for. The guest's own copying of
// the stack in and out stays as it is: the fiber's frames refer to the
// same guest stack addresses, and the engine restores the same bytes there.
